# Nextcloud Server Setup

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Set up a personal cloud server to enable secure local file storage and data management, with future plans for remote accessibility.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Networking, server configuration, initial security measures (firewall setup), and Nextcloud installation.

## Key Steps

### 1. Server Installation and Nextcloud Setup
   - **Operating System**: Installed Linux on a Dell Optiplex 7050 to serve as the primary host for the Nextcloud instance.
   - **Nextcloud Installation**: Configured Nextcloud for local network access, including setting up a MySQL database with user permissions.
   - **Database User**: Created a dedicated database user (`D-319`) for secure and organized management of Nextcloud’s backend.

### 2. Local Network Configuration
   - **Static IP Assignment**: Assigned a static IP to the server for consistent local access.
   - **Local Access Only**: Configured Nextcloud to be accessible over the local network initially, with plans for remote access in the future.

### 3. Security Measures
   - **Firewall Configuration**: Set up a basic firewall using `ufw` to restrict network access and only allow necessary services.
     - Allowed HTTPS traffic on port 443 (future remote access).
     - Enabled SSH access for secure remote management.
     - Configured local network restrictions to ensure security within the network.
   - **Planned Enhancements**: Remote access setup with port forwarding, SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt, and dynamic DNS for accessibility anywhere.

### 4. Future Improvements
   - **Remote Access**: Plans to implement secure remote access using DDNS and SSL.
   - **Data Backup Automation**: Considering a backup script using `rsync` to automate data backup to a designated drive.
   - **Enhanced Security**: Implementation of additional measures like SSH tunneling and potential VPN configuration for secure remote connections.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Router Configuration**: Adjusted router settings to assign a static IP and tested local network access.
- **Database Permissions**: Troubleshot initial permissions issues with MySQL user `D-319` to ensure secure database access for Nextcloud.
